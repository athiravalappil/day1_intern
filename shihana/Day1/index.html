    <h1>CCSIT VADAKARA</h1>
    <h2> Welcome to CCSIT</h2>
    
    <p> Vatakara, (Malayalam: [ʋɐɖɐgɐɾɐ]), (formerly Badagara), French: Bargaret, is 
        a Municipality, Taluk and a major town in
    the Kozhikode district of Kerala state, India. The municipality of Vatakara covers
     an area of 23.33 km2 (9.01 sq mi)[2]
    and is bordered by Mahé to the north and Payyoli to the south. It is the 
    headquarters of Vatakara taluk, which consists
    of 22 panchayats. During the reign of the Kolathiris and Zamorins, Vatakara was 
    known as Kadathanadu. During the British
    Raj, it was part of the North Malabar region of Malabar District in the state of 
    Madras.[3] The historic Lokanarkavu
    temple, made famous by the Vadakkan Pattukal (ballads of North Malabar), is 
    situated in Vatakara.[4][5] A new tardigrade
    (water bear) species collected from Vadakara coast has been named after Kerala 
    State; Stygarctus keralensis.
